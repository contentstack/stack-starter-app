Its power is being harnessed by leading companies across numerous industries — from banks examining countless data points in seconds to detect fraud, to call centers deploying chatbots to enhance customer interactions.<br>The recognition of AI in mainstream society might be a new phenomenon, but, it is not a new concept. The field of artificial intelligence came into existence in the year 1956. It took decades of effort to make notable progress in developing an AI system to make it a technological reality. In the business world, artificial intelligence has extensive uses. Most of us daily interact with an artificially intelligent system.<br>Artificial intelligence is not a replacement for human intelligence, instead, it is a support system. Although AI might not be good at completing simple tasks, it is skilled at processing and analyzing huge sets of data as compared to a human brain. Due to this quick process, business leaders with the help of AI can effectively resolve problems and take prompt decisions.<br>Artificial intelligence is kind of the second coming of software,\" said Amir Husain, founder, and CEO of machine learning company SparkCognition. \"It's a form of software that makes decisions on its own, that's able to act even in situations not foreseen by the programmers. Artificial intelligence has a wider latitude of decision-making ability as opposed to traditional software.\"<br>These traits make artificial intelligence extremely valuable throughout many industries. Artificial intelligence is a vital associate when it comes to looking for loopholes in computer network defenses. With the escalating complexity of cyberattacks, cybersecurity specialists require additional assistance and this where AI is playing a significant role. Perhaps the most superior tool developed might be AI, but just like everything else, it can have useful as well as unfavorable consequences. If AI can be put to use responsibly, transparently, and justly, it would be a boon for businesses advancing towards growth and building a better world.</p>","related_post":[{"uid":"blt6cf37ba6a34bfdcb","_content_type_uid":"blog_post"},{"uid":"blt9f7174b9ef8cec8a","_content_type_uid":"blog_post"}],"is_archived":false,"seo":{"meta_title":"The future of business with AI","meta_description":"Blog data","keywords":"The future of business with AI","enable_search_indexing":true},"tags":[],"locale":"en-us","uid":"blt778b121f2feabc69","ACL":{},"_version":18,"_in_progress":false,"publish_details":[{"environment":"blt3dfe0ed2ddf5fb14","locale":"en-us","time":"2021-03-24T14:11:59.384Z","version":18},{"environment":"blt6f4046f0d8dea679","locale":"en-us","time":"2021-03-24T14:11:59.384Z","version":18},{"environment":"blt19d47fc0d6304e8b","locale":"en-us","time":"2021-03-24T14:11:59.384Z","version":18}]},"blt6cf37ba6a34bfdcb":{"title":"Robotics – Changing Our Lives and Future","url":"/blog/robotics-changing-our-lives-and-future","author":[{"uid":"bltd70a94132541b1e0","_content_type_uid":"author"}],"date":"2021-02-09T08:10:18.000Z","featured_image":{"uid":"blt3b88f2e82bf4d793","content_type":"image/svg+xml","file_size":"32524","tags":[],"filename":"data-mining.svg","url":"https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/<api_key>/<asset_uid>/<entity_uid>/<asset_name>","ACL":[],"is_dir":false,"parent_uid":"bltae711ace911ffd90","_version":5,"title":"Data Mining","description":"","publish_details":[{"environment":"blt3dfe0ed2ddf5fb14","locale":"en-us","time":"2021-03-25T06:51:45.465Z","version":5},{"environment":"blt6f4046f0d8dea679","locale":"en-us","time":"2021-03-25T06:51:45.465Z","version":5},{"environment":"blt19d47fc0d6304e8b","locale":"en-us","time":"2021-03-25T06:51:45.465Z","version":5},{"environment":"blt3dfe0ed2ddf5fb14","locale":"fr-fr","time":"2021-03-25T06:51:53.985Z","version":5},{"environment":"blt19d47fc0d6304e8b","locale":"fr-fr","time":"2021-03-25T06:51:53.985Z","version":5},{"environment":"blt6f4046f0d8dea679","locale":"fr-fr","time":"2021-03-25T06:51:53.985Z","version":5}]},"body":"<p>Envision a future where robots are so integrated into the foundation of human life that they become as common as smartphones.

Managing the production, design and distribution of content has become a major function of most marketing departments. The marketing team has grown used to doing it all and being enabled to design and deploy a web page within their team. This is the case for a traditional CMS deployment and within large organizations the lack of governance in this model can prove troublesome.</p>\n<h2>Traditional or \"Coupled\" CMS</h2>\n<p>There are clearly pros to doing it alone, but that ability has come with some rather serious drawbacks. For starters, pages need to conform to the database structure they sit atop. By extension, content needs to conform as well. Before you know it, content is being forced into structures that aren’t friendly, intuitive and may not perform to expectations. For all of the benefits of the WYSIWYG editor of the traditional CMS, it can only take an organization so far.</p>\n<p>Keep in mind that the traditional model was established for websites and was able to modify with responsive themes to adequately manage mobile, but there’s a world of change coming that won’t be satisfied with these systems. Also, traditional systems require components beyond the database, creating challenges for management and scale.</p>\n<h2>Decoupled CMS</h2>\n<p>Demands for greater flexibility and scale have led to the concept of a decoupled CMS. In this world, marketers focus on creating content, and developers focus on the presentation of the content in the front-end. With this approach, the style and presentation of the content is not stored within the content, giving greater flexibility. Marketers do what they’re good at (content), and developers do what they know and love (coding).</p>\n<p>The downside to a decoupled approach is that the moment a front-end is chosen, the limitations of that choice are then baked into the solution. So while you’ve solved some of the limitations of the traditional approach, you haven’t solved all of them. You’re still in a world that’s tightly coupled to the past.</p>\n<p>This decoupled model, like the traditional model, hits its limitations when content needs to move quickly to cross-platform use cases.</p>\n<h2>Headless CMS or API-First CMS</h2>\n<p>The need to have systems with even greater flexibility both now and into the future has given rise to another option headless CMS. There is some overlap with decoupled CMS in the sense that it allows for healthy separation between marketing and development needs. However, a truly headless model allows for the limits imposed by any coupled front-end to be thrown out . You end up with centralized model for content but a flexible and better-performing model for where content can go.</p>\n<p>This is because the Application Program Interface (API) approach of a headless CMS allows content creation to forever remain separate and distinct. Born in tandem with the explosion of API growth and the focus on microservice architecture, anything can call content from a headless CMS. Content becomes just another (but very important) service that can be called by a website, a mobile device, a software platform, an automobile, VR headset, Jumbotron or whatever tomorrow’s technology looks like.</p>","related_post":[{"uid":"blt9f7174b9ef8cec8a","_content_type_uid":"blog_post"},{"uid":"blt778b121f2feabc69","_content_type_uid":"blog_post"}],"seo":{"meta_title":"Traditional vs. Decoupled vs. Headless CMS – Know the Difference","meta_description":"blog data","keywords":"Traditional vs. Decoupled vs. Headless CMS – Know the Difference","enable_search_indexing":true},"tags":[],"locale":"en-us","uid":"bltd57698ce7ce53472","ACL":{},"_version":8,"_in_progress":false,"is_archived":true,"publish_details":[{"environment":"blt3dfe0ed2ddf5fb14","locale":"en-us","time":"2021-03-24T14:11:59.413Z","version":8},{"environment":"blt6f4046f0d8dea679","locale":"en-us","time":"2021-03-24T14:11:59.413Z","version":8},{"environment":"blt19d47fc0d6304e8b","locale":"en-us","time":"2021-03-24T14:11:59.413Z","version":8}]},"blt48053d67988bf0f3":{"title":"Data Mining and its significance in Business Analytics","url":"/blog/data-mining-and-its-significance-in-business-analytics","author":[{"uid":"blt6b7cf88303c9796e","_content_type_uid":"author"}],"date":"2021-02-03T08:55:29.000Z","featured_image":{"uid":"blt3b88f2e82bf4d793","content_type":"image/svg+xml","file_size":"32524","tags":[],"filename":"data-mining.svg","url":"https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/<api_key>/<asset_uid>/<entity_uid>/<asset_name>","ACL":[],"is_dir":false,"parent_uid":"bltae711ace911ffd90","_version":5,"title":"Data Mining","description":"","publish_details":[{"environment":"blt3dfe0ed2ddf5fb14","locale":"en-us","time":"2021-03-25T06:51:45.465Z","version":5},{"environment":"blt6f4046f0d8dea679","locale":"en-us","time":"2021-03-25T06:51:45.465Z","version":5},{"environment":"blt19d47fc0d6304e8b","locale":"en-us","time":"2021-03-25T06:51:45.465Z","version":5},{"environment":"blt3dfe0ed2ddf5fb14","locale":"fr-fr","time":"2021-03-25T06:51:53.985Z","version":5},{"environment":"blt19d47fc0d6304e8b","locale":"fr-fr","time":"2021-03-25T06:51:53.985Z","version":5},{"environment":"blt6f4046f0d8dea679","locale":"fr-fr","time":"2021-03-25T06:51:53.985Z","version":5}]},"body":"<p>We have always heard people in the business world say how data is valuable and must be secured.

Organizations utilize software to analyze large sets of raw data and look for patterns. These patterns help organizations learn more about their customers or even the general public.</p>\n<p>This information pulled out helps to improve the decision-making process.

Data mining and machine learning both use patterns and analytics. Data mining looks for patterns that are already present in data. Patterns bought to light by data mining need human intervention to make decisions. Data mining gets patterns (information) from large datasets, and data analytics is when organizations decide to take this information and dive into it to learn more.</p>\n<p>Businesses that make use of data mining have an advantage. They have a better understanding of their customers, oversight of business operations, improved customer acquisition, and new business opportunities. Also, they acquire a perception of potential customers, new ways to market and improve their systems. Data mining helps businesses advance without any obstacles.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Data mining helps organizations with the detection of fraudulent activity and forestall potential fraud. Instead of relying only on the human experience, patterns generated from data mining can help you make a creative and innovative decision, one which might be beyond human analysis.</p><br>","related_post":[{"uid":"blt9f7174b9ef8cec8a","_content_type_uid":"blog_post"},{"uid":"blt6cf37ba6a34bfdcb","_content_type_uid":"blog_post"}],"seo":{"meta_title":"Data Mining and its significance in Business Analytics","meta_description":"blog data","keywords":"Data Mining and its significance in Business Analytics","enable_search_indexing":true},"tags":[],"locale":"en-us","uid":"blt48053d67988bf0f3","ACL":{},"_version":12,"_in_progress":false,"is_archived":false,"publish_details":[{"environment":"blt6f4046f0d8dea679","locale":"en-us","time":"2021-03-24T14:11:59.423Z","version":12},{"environment":"blt3dfe0ed2ddf5fb14","locale":"en-us","time":"2021-03-24T14:11:59.423Z","version":12},{"environment":"blt19d47fc0d6304e8b","locale":"en-us","time":"2021-03-24T14:11:59.423Z","version":12}]},"bltac9658fb3d80d338":{"title":"Headless CMS: The Solution to Top Challenges in Ecommerce","url":"/blog/headless-cms-the-solution-to-top-challenges-in-ecommerce","author":[{"uid":"blt7de6e660947b12de","_content_type_uid":"author"}],"date":"2021-02-07T08:13:44.000Z","featured_image":{"uid":"blt377b2541028bdb81","content_type":"image/svg+xml","file_size":"53205","tags":[],"filename":"headless-cms-solution.svg","url":"https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/<api_key>/<asset_uid>/<entity_uid>/<asset_name>","ACL":[],"is_dir":false,"parent_uid":"bltae711ace911ffd90","_version":4,"title":"Headless CMS Solution","description":"","publish_details":[{"environment":"blt3dfe0ed2ddf5fb14","locale":"en-us","time":"2021-03-25T06:51:45.434Z","version":4},{"environment":"blt6f4046f0d8dea679","locale":"en-us","time":"2021-03-25T06:51:45.434Z","version":4},{"environment":"blt19d47fc0d6304e8b","locale":"en-us","time":"2021-03-25T06:51:45.434Z","version":4},{"environment":"blt3dfe0ed2ddf5fb14","locale":"fr-fr","time":"2021-03-25T06:51:53.940Z","version":4},{"environment":"blt19d47fc0d6304e8b","locale":"fr-fr","time":"2021-03-25T06:51:53.940Z","version":4},{"environment":"blt6f4046f0d8dea679","locale":"fr-fr","time":"2021-03-25T06:51:53.940Z","version":4}]},"body":"<p>In a rapidly evolving environment with technology and content demands existing in a multi-channel—and devices—world, Marketers in ecommerce face many unique hurdles that are both challenging and exciting—but can be very stressful.</p>\n<p>In conversations in the last few years with prospects, most retail organizations believe they lag behind their competitors when it comes to marketing performance and managing the right CMS technology (web content management system).

This can make it a nightmare to properly test and stage content each week.</p>\n<p>For example, every week you may have sales, ads, and related content to set up and stage. test next week’s promotions if in the same view, you also saw the discounts queued for the week after and some of the marketing content for the upcoming Black Friday sales event.</p>\n<h2>The Solution – Project Spaces with SampleSite</h2>\n<p></p>\n<p>SampleSite solves this by supporting as many project spaces as needed. You can create a project space for each individual event and deliver only the relevant content.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>For example, you may have three discounts to set up: one for next week, one for the week after, and a third that spans both weeks. A CMS solution like SampleSite&nbsp;lets businesses create a project view for each testing before the promotions even begin.</p>\n<p>An added advantage to this approach is that you can easily update the discount and roll it out to both weeks when you need to change it.</p>","related_post":[{"uid":"blt48053d67988bf0f3","_content_type_uid":"blog_post"},{"uid":"blt778b121f2feabc69","_content_type_uid":"blog_post"}],"is_archived":true,"seo":{"meta_title":"Blog","meta_description":"Blog data","keywords":"Headless CMS: The Solution to Top Challenges in Ecommerce","enable_search_indexing":true},"tags":[],"locale":"en-us","uid":"bltac9658fb3d80d338","ACL":{},"_version":12,"_in_progress":false,"publish_details":[{"environment":"blt3dfe0ed2ddf5fb14","locale":"en-us","time":"2021-03-24T14:11:59.431Z","version":12},{"environment":"blt6f4046f0d8dea679","locale":"en-us","time":"2021-03-24T14:11:59.432Z","version":12},{"environment":"blt19d47fc0d6304e8b","locale":"en-us","time":"2021-03-24T14:11:59.432Z","version":12}]}}
